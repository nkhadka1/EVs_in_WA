The project was done as a part of Data Analysis couse while in my Graduate School. This projects contains the list of all the EVs that were registered at Washington State.

The growth in the usage of Electric Vehicles has skyrocketed in the recent years. Washington State lies on the Pacific NorthWest part of America. Since I was based on WA, I chose the state and the study. The data was collected from Kaggle. I received an A for the project.
